# *Project Overview*:
This project explores the capabilities and performance of SQL and NoSQL databases by transferring data from a MySQL relational database to a Neo4j graph database. The project involves data migration, schema design, relationship mapping, and query execution to compare the efficiency and effectiveness of both database systems. Additionally, the project leverages FIFA World Cup data to populate the Neo4j database, enabling the execution of complex queries to analyze relationships and patterns within the dataset.

# *Key Objectives*:

1. **Data Migration**: Transfer structured data from MySQL to Neo4j, ensuring data integrity and consistency during the process.

2- **Schema Design**: Design and implement a schema in Neo4j, defining nodes, relationships, and properties to represent the data effectively.

3- **Query Execution**: Perform queries on both MySQL and Neo4j to compare query performance, focusing on response times and scalability.

4- **World Cup Data Analysis**: Populate Neo4j with FIFA World Cup data, create meaningful relationships (e.g., teams, players, matches), and execute queries to extract insights.

5- **Performance Comparison**: Analyze and document the strengths and weaknesses of SQL (MySQL) and NoSQL (Neo4j) in handling relational and graph-based queries.

# *Methodology*:

- **Data Preparation**: Clean and preprocess the dataset to ensure compatibility with both MySQL and Neo4j.

- **Schema Creation**: Define relational schemas in MySQL and graph-based schemas in Neo4j, including nodes (e.g., players, teams) and relationships (e.g., played_for, participated_in).

- **Query Design**: Develop equivalent queries in both databases to compare performance, such as searching for player statistics, team performance, or match outcomes.

- **Performance Metrics**: Measure and compare query execution times, scalability, and ease of querying complex relationships.

# *Outcome*:
This project provides a comprehensive comparison of SQL and NoSQL databases, highlighting the advantages of Neo4j for graph-based data analysis and relationship-heavy queries. It also demonstrates the practical application of Neo4j in analyzing real-world datasets, such as FIFA World Cup data, to uncover insights that are difficult to achieve with traditional relational databases.
